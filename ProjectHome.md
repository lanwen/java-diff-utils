Diff Utils library is an OpenSource library for performing the comparison operations between texts: computing diffs, applying patches, generating unified diffs or parsing them, generating diff output for easy future displaying (like side-by-side view) and so on.

Main reason to build this library was the lack of easy-to-use libraries with all the usual stuff you need while working with diff files. Originally it was inspired by JRCS library and it's nice design of diff module.

## Main Features ##

  * computing the difference between two texts.
  * capable to hand more than plain ascci. Arrays or List of any type that implements hashCode() and equals() correctly can be subject to differencing using this library
  * patch and unpatch the text with the given patch
  * parsing the unified diff format
  * producing human-readable differences

### Algoritms ###

This library implements Myer's diff algorithm. But it can easily replaced by any other which is better for handing your texts. I have plan to add implementation of some in future.

### Changelog ###

  * Version 1.2
    * JDK 1.5 compatibility
    * Ant build script
    * Generate output in unified diff format (thanks for Bill James)

### To Install ###

Just add the code below to your maven dependencies:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.googlecode.java-diff-utils</groupId>
    <artifactId>diffutils</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

And for Ivy:
```
<dependency org="com.googlecode.java-diff-utils" name="diffutils" rev="1.2.1"/>
```

## Coming eventually ##

  * support for inline diffs in output
  * helpers for showing side-by-side, line-by-line diffs or text with inter-line and intra-line change highlights
  * customization of diff algorithm for better experience while computing diffs between strings (ignoring blank lines or spaces, etc)
  * generating output in other formats (not only unified). E.g. CVS.
